Question:

To sync an order or product across multiple systems (e.g., Shopify, HotWax, ERP/NetSuite), the OMS needs to know each systemâ€™s unique identifier for that product. This query retrieves the Shopify ID, HotWax ID, and ERP ID (NetSuite ID) for all products.

Fields to retrieve:

--> PRODUCT_ID (internal OMS ID)

--> SHOPIFY_ID

--> HOTWAX_ID

--> ERP_ID or NETSUITE_ID (depending on naming)

Solution:

```
select 
	gi.product_id,
	max(CASE WHEN gi.good_identification_type_id = 'SHOPIFY_PROD_ID' THEN gi.id_value END) AS SHOPIFY_ID,
	max(case when gi.good_identification_type_id = 'SKU' then gi.id_value end) as HOTWAX_ID,
	max(case when gi.good_identification_type_id = 'ERP_ID' then gi.id_value end) as NETSUITE_ID
from good_identification gi group by gi.product_id;
```
Reasoning:

since all the field values were available in the good_identification table, so took the values directly from there. Query has been written in such a way as i wanted to filter id's from the same coloumn.
